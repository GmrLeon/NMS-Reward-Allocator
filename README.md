# hello i am the TRUE readme
i'm a little program to parse the GcAlienPuzzleTable of No Man's Sky and append rewards to existing GcAlienPuzzleEntries! I make you have to copy & paste less if you want to change all the rewards for certain interactions!

More specifically for NMS modding newcomers!
GcAlienPuzzleTable refers to this specific file, but remember to decompile it first with [Monkeyman's MBINCompiler](https://github.com/monkeyman192/MBINCompiler/releases): `METADATA\REALITY\TABLES\NMS_DIALOG_GCALIENPUZZLETABLE.MBIN`

The above file may be found after you've unpacked your game files, but for more detail on that, check over on the [NMS Modding Wiki.](http://nmsmodding.wikia.com/wiki/Getting_Started)
